# Museum app
## Example
We have the following visiting hours:
* 09:40 - 10:10
* 10:00 - 10:30
* 10:10 - 10:40
* 10:20 - 10:50

As a result, we get the following time points (TimePoint.class) on the graph:
* 9:40, 10:00, 10:10, 10:20, 10:30, 10:40, 10:50

The following graph shows the intersection of time points and visits.
As we can see, at 10:10, 10:20 and 10:30 the number of visits was maximum (max = 3).
